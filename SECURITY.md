# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

The NXS Dashboard takes security seriously. This document outlines our security policies, procedures for reporting security vulnerabilities, and best practices for contributors.

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately:

### DO NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities

### Preferred Reporting Method:
1. **Email**: Send details to security@nxs-dashboard.dev (if available)
2. **Private GitHub Issue**: Create a private vulnerability report via GitHub Security tab
3. **Direct Contact**: Reach out to repository maintainers privately

### Information to Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline:
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours  
- **Resolution**: Critical issues within 7 days, others within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is implemented

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Requirements

### For All Contributors:

#### üö´ NEVER COMMIT SECRETS
- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys, tokens, or credentials
- **Environment Files**: All `.env*` files must be in `.gitignore`
- **Passwords**: No hardcoded passwords or secrets in source code
- **Certificates**: Private keys and certificates must never be committed

#### ‚úÖ REQUIRED SECURITY PRACTICES
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Follow principle of least privilege for API permissions
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use HTTPS for all external communications
- Enable security headers in web applications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities

### For NXS Team:

#### üîê Secret Management
- Use proper secret management systems (Clerk, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Rotate credentials regularly (quarterly minimum)
- Use unique, strong credentials for each service
- Implement multi-factor authentication on all accounts
- Never share credentials via email, Slack, or other channels

#### üîç Security Reviews
- All authentication/authorization code requires security review
- Third-party integrations must be security assessed
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Code review process includes security considerations

## üìã Secure Development Checklist

Before submitting any code that handles:
- User authentication
- Third-party API integration  
- User data processing
- File uploads
- Database operations

Ensure:

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Proper input validation implemented
- [ ] SQL injection protection in place
- [ ] XSS prevention measures implemented
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Secure HTTP headers configured
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Logging doesn't capture sensitive data
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security-focused code review completed

## üîß Security Tools & Automation

### Required Tools:
- **Secret Scanning**: Pre-commit hooks to detect credentials
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability checks on all dependencies
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Container Scanning**: Security scanning of Docker images (if used)

### CI/CD Security:
- Automated security testing in build pipeline
- Secret scanning in CI/CD workflows
- Dependency vulnerability blocking for critical issues
- Security regression testing

## üö® Incident Response

### If You Discover Exposed Credentials:

#### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (within 15 minutes):
1. **DO NOT** create public issues or commits mentioning the exposure
2. **Revoke** the exposed credentials immediately at the provider
3. **Notify** security team and relevant stakeholders privately
4. **Document** the incident for post-mortem analysis

#### FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS (within 4 hours):
1. Generate new credentials and update systems
2. Remove exposed credentials from git history
3. Assess potential impact and unauthorized access
4. Implement additional safeguards to prevent recurrence
5. Update team on lessons learned

## üîê Widget Integration Security

### Third-Party App Integrations:
- **OAuth 2.0**: Use only secure OAuth flows, never store passwords
- **Minimal Permissions**: Request only necessary API scopes
- **Token Management**: Securely store and rotate access tokens
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt all user data and integration credentials
- **Permission Boundaries**: Implement proper access controls between integrations

### Data Handling:
- **Classification**: Classify all data by sensitivity level
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies
- **User Consent**: Clear consent mechanisms for data access
- **Cross-widget Isolation**: Prevent data leakage between integrations

## üìä Security Metrics

We track these security metrics:
- **Credential Exposures**: Target = 0
- **Vulnerability Response Time**: Target < 24 hours for critical
- **Security Test Coverage**: Target > 80%
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Target = 0 critical/high
- **Security Training Completion**: Target = 100% quarterly

## üéì Security Training

All team members must complete:
- **Initial Security Training**: Within first 30 days
- **Quarterly Updates**: Security awareness refreshers
- **Role-Specific Training**: Additional training based on role
- **Incident Response Training**: Annual incident simulation exercises

## üìû Emergency Contacts

### Security Incident Response Team:
- **CISO**: Chief Information Security Officer (primary contact)
- **CTO**: Chief Technology Officer (technical coordination)  
- **CEO**: Chief Executive Officer (strategic decisions)
- **Legal**: Legal team (compliance and disclosure requirements)

### External Resources:
- **Clerk Support**: For authentication-related security issues
- **GitHub Security**: For platform security concerns
- **Legal Counsel**: For regulatory compliance guidance

## üîÑ Security Policy Updates

This security policy is reviewed and updated:
- **Quarterly**: Regular review and improvement
- **After Incidents**: Updates based on lessons learned
- **When New Tech**: Updates for new technologies or integrations
- **Regulatory Changes**: Updates for compliance requirements
