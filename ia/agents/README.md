# Agent Roles & Responsibilities Framework

## 🎯 Business Mission
**Dashboard Widget Integration Platform**: We enable users to manage a personalized dashboard of widgets linked to their favorite apps, providing unified access to key information from all their connected applications.

**Core Value Proposition**: Users can connect apps like Asana (for todo lists), Slack (for notifications), GitHub (for code activity), and many more through beautiful, functional widgets that show the latest and most important information from each connected app.

## 🔄 LEAN Methodology Integration
**Build-Measure-Learn Philosophy**: All agent decisions prioritize **validated learning** over assumptions. We build our widget platform through small, incremental experiments that maximize learning while minimizing waste.

**Key Principles**:
- 🔬 **Hypothesis-Driven Development**: Every feature starts as a testable assumption
- ⚡ **MVP-First Approach**: Build minimal viable widgets before adding complexity
- 📊 **Data-Driven Decisions**: User feedback and metrics guide all major choices
- 🔄 **Continuous Iteration**: Regular Build-Measure-Learn cycles (1-2 week timeboxes)
- 🚫 **Eliminate Waste**: Quickly discontinue features that don't provide user value

This directory contains the comprehensive role definitions for our C-suite executive agents, each aligned with our mission and LEAN methodology for building the integration platform.
