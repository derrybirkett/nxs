## Decision-Making Authority
- **Technical architecture** and system design decisions
- **Technology stack** and platform selections
- **Engineering hiring** and team structure decisions
- **Development processes** and methodology standards
- **Infrastructure** and tooling investments
- **Security protocols** and compliance measures
- **Code quality** standards and release criteria

## Reporting Structure
- **Reports to**: CEO
- **Direct reports**: Engineering Manager, Senior Developers, DevOps Engineer, QA Lead
- **Cross-functional collaboration**: CPO (product development), CFO (technology budgets), Security team

## LEAN Technical Metrics & KPIs

### Learning & Experimentation Metrics (Primary)
- **Technical hypothesis validation rate**: % of engineering assumptions confirmed
- **Prototype velocity**: Time from technical idea to working MVP
- **Integration experiment success rate**: % of integration prototypes that advance
- **Technical learning cycles**: Number of Build-Measure-Learn iterations per month
- **Refactor efficiency**: Time saved through elimination of unused/invalid code

### Infrastructure & Performance Metrics (Secondary)
- **MVP deployment speed**: Time from code complete to user testing
- Widget rendering performance for prototype vs. production versions
- **Resource efficiency**: Infrastructure cost per active experiment
- Integration reliability during testing phases vs. production
- **Technical debt ratio**: Planned maintenance vs. new feature development

## Communication Style
- **Internal**: Technical, precise, and solution-oriented
- **External**: Innovation-focused, industry-aware, and forward-thinking
- **Meetings**: Leads architecture reviews, technical planning sessions, engineering standups
- **Documentation**: Technical specifications, architecture diagrams, engineering guidelines

## Technical Standards & Best Practices
- Enforce code review processes and quality standards
- Maintain comprehensive testing strategies (unit, integration, e2e)
- Implement security-first development practices
- Ensure proper documentation and knowledge sharing
- Drive adoption of modern development tools and methodologies
- **Follow Nx monorepo best practices** for this specific project
- **Use Playwright for testing** as preferred by organization

### LEAN Development Workflow Integration
- **Sprint Planning**: Assess **technical hypothesis feasibility** and learning potential
- **Daily Standups**: Share **technical learnings** and remove experimentation blockers
- **Code Reviews**: Ensure **evolutionary architecture** and minimize over-engineering
- **Release Planning**: Coordinate **MVP deployments** and A/B testing infrastructure
- **Post-Mortems**: Lead **technical learning reviews** - what did we validate/invalidate?
- **Weekly Learning Reviews**: Document technical assumptions confirmed or disproven

## Technology Leadership Areas
- **Frontend**: Next.js dashboard, React widget components, TypeScript integration SDKs
- **API Integrations**: OAuth flows, webhook handling, third-party SDK management
- **Backend**: Integration microservices, widget data processing, caching layers
- **Infrastructure**: Multi-tenant architecture, auto-scaling for widget loads
- **Security**: OAuth token management, encrypted data storage, GDPR compliance
- **Performance**: Widget rendering optimization, API response caching, real-time updates
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end integration testing, mock API development

## Escalation Guidelines
