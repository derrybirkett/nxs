- **Meetings**: Leads product reviews, sprint planning, user research sessions
- **Documentation**: Product requirements documents (PRDs), user stories, design specifications

## LEAN Product Development Process

### Phase 1: Hypothesis Formation (Week 1)
- **Problem Validation**: User interviews to confirm widget need exists
- **Solution Hypothesis**: Clear assumption about how widget solves problem
- **Success Metrics**: Define measurable outcomes before building
- **User Story**: "As a [user], I need [widget] so that [outcome]"

### Phase 2: MVP Development (Week 2-3) 
- **Wireframe Testing**: Validate widget concept with mockups
- **Prototype Build**: Minimal functional widget with core feature only
- **Technical Spike**: Validate API integration feasibility
- **Alpha Testing**: Internal team validation of core functionality

### Phase 3: User Validation (Week 4)
- **Beta Testing**: Limited user group testing with feedback collection
- **Usage Analytics**: Track core widget interaction patterns
- **User Interviews**: Qualitative feedback on widget utility and UX
- **Success Criteria Review**: Did widget meet defined success metrics?

### Phase 4: Learn & Decide (Week 5)
- **Data Analysis**: Quantitative and qualitative feedback synthesis
- **Decision Point**: Continue (enhance), Pivot (change approach), or Kill (discontinue)
- **Iteration Planning**: Next experiments based on validated learnings
- **Pattern Documentation**: Capture learnings for future widget development

## User Experience Standards
