### Next Steps
- Begin feature development on the nexus application
- Add initial components and pages
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
- Consider adding additional libraries as the project grows

## Version 0.2.0 - Agent Roles Framework (2024-01-24)

### Agent System Implementation
- Created comprehensive C-suite agent roles framework in `ia/agents/`
- Defined 6 executive agent roles: CEO, CTO, CPO, CMO, CFO, CHRO, COO
- Established clear reporting hierarchy and cross-functional collaboration patterns
- Integrated agent roles with development workflow and release process

### Agent Role Definitions
- **CEO**: Strategic leadership, final decision authority, stakeholder relations
- **CTO**: Technical architecture, engineering leadership, development standards
- **CPO**: Product strategy, user experience, roadmap management
- **CMO**: Marketing strategy, brand management, blog content creation
- **CFO**: Financial planning, budget allocation, fiscal responsibility
- **CHRO**: Human resources, organizational culture, talent management
- **COO**: Operations management, process optimization, cross-department coordination

### Framework Features
- Decision-making authority clearly defined for each role
- Escalation guidelines and cross-functional collaboration patterns
- Integration with existing development workflow (Nx, Playwright, etc.)
- Special integration with release process and blog management
- Comprehensive documentation with organizational hierarchy

### Development Process Integration
- CMO responsible for writing blog posts for new features
- Activity log updates as part of release process
- Git branching best practices followed for feature development
- All roles designed to work within existing technical architecture

## Version 0.3.0 - Business Mission Alignment (2024-01-24)

### Business Definition
- **Core Mission**: Dashboard Widget Integration Platform
- **Value Proposition**: Unified access to favorite apps through personalized dashboard widgets
- **Target Use Case**: Users connecting apps like Asana (todos), Slack (notifications), GitHub (code activity)
- **Key Benefit**: "Single pane of glass" for all connected application data

### Agent Role Realignment
- **CEO**: Focus on integration partnerships and platform strategic vision
- **CTO**: Specialized in API integrations, OAuth flows, and widget rendering architecture
- **CPO**: Widget ecosystem strategy, dashboard UX, and integration prioritization
- **CMO**: Integration-focused marketing, educational content, and use case showcases
- **CFO**: SaaS business model optimization, API cost management, subscription metrics
- **COO**: Third-party app partnerships, integration reliability, user onboarding
- **CHRO**: Technical talent acquisition focused on integration and API expertise

### Strategic Focus Areas
- API integration architecture and third-party app connections
- Widget customization and dashboard personalization
- User onboarding and time-to-first-widget optimization
- Integration partnership development and maintenance
- SaaS subscription model and unit economics
- Technical talent acquisition for integration expertise

## Version 0.4.0 - LEAN Methodology Integration (2024-01-24)

### LEAN Philosophy Adoption
- **Core Principle**: Build-Measure-Learn cycles prioritizing validated learning over assumptions
- **Development Approach**: MVP-first widget development with 1-2 week time-boxed experiments
- **Decision Framework**: Hypothesis-driven development with data-driven pivot/persevere decisions
- **Cultural Shift**: Embrace failure as learning, eliminate waste, focus on user validation

### Agent Role LEAN Transformation
- **CEO**: Champions validated learning approach, makes decisions based on experiment results
- **CTO**: Focuses on evolutionary architecture, disposable prototypes, rapid technical iteration
- **CPO**: Implements 5-week widget development cycles (Hypothesis → MVP → Test → Learn → Decide)
- **CMO**: Uses hypothesis-driven content creation with A/B testing and validated messaging
- **CFO**: Tracks learning metrics alongside business metrics, validates unit economics through experiments
- **COO**: Optimizes operations through validated process improvements and partnership experiments
- **CHRO**: Hires technical talent comfortable with ambiguity and experimentation culture

### LEAN Implementation Framework
- **Phase 1**: Hypothesis Formation - Define testable assumptions with clear success criteria
- **Phase 2**: MVP Development - Build smallest possible valuable widget (1-2 weeks max)
- **Phase 3**: Measurement & Learning - Collect usage data, user feedback, and performance metrics
- **Phase 4**: Iterate or Pivot - Continue, pivot, or kill based on validated learning

### Key LEAN Metrics Introduced
- **Learning Metrics**: Experiment velocity, hypothesis validation rate, learning cycles per month
- **Efficiency Metrics**: MVP success rate, prototype velocity, feature kill rate
- **User Validation**: Time-to-first-widget, user feedback quality, validated user stories
- **Business Impact**: Revenue from validated features vs. experimental features
